To do this, you have to slice the butternut lengthwise halfway through to the center, careful not to cut deeper than that. You can also use a mandolin (be careful) or a sharp knife.\r\n\tPreheat oven to 375°F.\r\n\tIn a medium bowl combine ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, parsley and egg, mix.\r\n\tIn a deep 9×12 casserole dish spread 3/4 cup of sauce on the bottom and layer 12 rounds of butternut slices to cover. Spread 3/4 cup of the ricotta cheese mixture, then top with 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese and 1 cup sauce. Second Layer: Lay 12 more rounds of butternut, 3/4 cup ricotta mixture, 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup sauce. Third Layer: 12 slices butternut, 1 1/2 cups sauce and cover with foil.\r\n\tBake covered 30 minutes.\r\n\tRemove foil, cook uncovered 30 minutes (this helps dry out excess moisture). Top with remaining cheese and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling, 5 minutes.\r\n\tLet stand about 5 – 10 minutes before serving.",

Zucchini has a lot of water when cooked, salting it takes out a lot of moisture.

Place on paper towels to soak any excess moisture.\r\n\tPreheat oven to 375°.\r\n\tIn a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese and egg. Stir well.\r\n\tIn a 9x12 casserole spread 1/2 cup of sauce on the bottom and layer the zucchini to cover. Spread 1/2 cup of the ricotta cheese mixture, then top with 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese and repeat the process until all your ingredients are used up. The last layer top with remaining zucchini and sauce, cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover the foil and bake 20 minutes (to dry up the sauce) then place the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and bake until melted, 10 minutes.\r\n\tLet stand about 5 - 10 minutes before serving.",
